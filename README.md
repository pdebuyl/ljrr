ljrr: Lennard-Jones reproducible research
=========================================

Copyright Â© 2014 Pierre de Buyl

ljrr is a repository containing reproducible computations for Molecular Dynamics
simulations of Lennard-Jones particles.
The parameters are those of the
[benchmark simulations](http://www.nist.gov/mml/csd/informatics_research/lj_pure.cfm)
proposed by the
[National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST)](http://nist.gov/) for
the "MD NVE" category.

Requirements and usage
----------------------

ljrr requires:

- [lammps](http://lammps.sandia.gov)
- [Make](http://www.gnu.org/software/make/)
- [bash](https://www.gnu.org/software/bash/)
- [HDF5](http://www.hdfgroup.org/HDF5/)
- [Python](https://www.python.org/) with [NumPy](http://www.numpy.org/),
  [matplotlib](http://matplotlib.org/) and [h5py](http://www.h5py.org/)

Apart from lammps that requires a separate installation, the other packages can
be installed under Debian with

    apt-get install make bash libhdf5-dev hdf5-tools python python-numpy python-matplotlib python-h5py

The program called `sftmpl` (for "Single file templater") is available via
pip

    pip install sftmpl


or at <https://github.com/pdebuyl/sftmpl>. If you do not have installation
rights on your machine, you may use `pip install --user sftmpl`.

The custom dump style for [H5MD](http://nongnu.org/h5md/) is available at
<https://github.com/pdebuyl/lammps> and is needed to take advantage of the
analysis tools in ljrr.

To reproduce the test computation, invoke the make command.

    make all_nist

This runs simulations for all parameters of the nist benchmark and stores the
simulation results in `simu_lj3d_NIST_{RHO}` (where `{RHO}` is the value of the
density).
The program `code/compute_rdf.py` then computes the radial distributions
function from the simulation data and stores it in `data/nist_{RHO}_rdf.txt`.

If a lammps executable named `lmp_mpi` is not found in your PATH environment
variable, you may specify it on the command-line

    make all_nist LMP=/path/to/lammps

Specific parameters to the Lennard-Jones system can be appended to the
command-line as `RHO` (density), `NSTEPS` (number of steps for the run), `SIDE`
(number of particles along each dimension, so that the total number is
`SIDE**3`) and `SEED`. If no seed is given, a new one is generated from the
`/dev/urandom` device of your computer.

    make RHO=0.6 SEED=123
